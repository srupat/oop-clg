## Hackathon Project: Chrome Extension for Transparent T&Cs

**Problem:** 
* Users often blindly agree to Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) agreements without fully understanding their implications.
* T&Cs can be lengthy, complex, and full of jargon, making them difficult for users to read and understand.
* This lack of transparency can lead to users unknowingly agreeing to unfair or risky terms.

**Proposed Solution:**
* Develop a Chrome browser extension that automatically analyzes T&Cs agreements and highlights key points, including:
    * **Non-standard clauses:** Clauses that deviate from common language or standard practices.
    * **Potentially risky clauses:** Clauses that grant excessive permissions, violate user privacy, or impose unfair obligations.
    * **Topic-specific clauses:** Clauses relevant to specific user-defined topics (e.g., data privacy, financial obligations, intellectual property).
* Present these key points in a clear, concise, and user-friendly format, allowing users to quickly grasp the essential information.
* Provide explanations for flagged clauses, including relevant legal references or comparisons to standard language.
* Allow users to customize the extension to prioritize different types of clauses and adjust its sensitivity level.

**Expected Outcomes:**
* Empower users to make informed decisions about online services.
* Promote transparency and accountability in the digital space.
* Increase user trust and engagement with online platforms.
* Create a safer and more secure online environment for everyone.
